This is the final project for OOP2

We have created a Resturant Managment System for Great Burger.
In this ReadMe we will explain the project functionality

Firstly, for the Orders the following problems have been solved and now can be completed.



Users can,

- Add new items to orders. 
- Add customer names and their table number to the database as well as their order. 
- Complete Orders and add them to the Order History which is stored in our database. 
- Users can view the Order History but using the buttons which will display the table of information from the database. 



Secondly, We allow the User to have access to Inventory and allow them to,

- Add new items to the menu and database.
- Update the items on the menu and database.
- Add prices to items in the database.
- Remove items from the menu and database.


Lastly, we allow for Employee Managment through our Employee page the following actions are avaliable,

- The addition of new employees into the database
- Allow us to update the information of the employee such as name and etc. and store it in the database
- Allows us to remove employees from the database.
  

In this application we help the Resturant with multiple managment issues. By using this application the client will be able to
- Manage incoming orders to the resturant.
- Manage order history of the resturant.
- Manage the Menu of the resturant.
- And manage the employees of the resturant.
As well as having an updated and modern GUI which will allow for ease of use and easy adaptation into the enviorment.

This will allow the resturant to function with more efficency and providing better service overall to their customers and resulting in increased profits and a better reputation.
